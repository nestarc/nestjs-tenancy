## Security Design

This library handles tenant isolation at the database level via PostgreSQL Row Level Security (RLS). Key security properties:

- **SQL injection prevention**: `set_config()` is called via `$executeRaw` tagged template with bind parameters — no string interpolation
- **Transaction-scoped isolation**: `set_config(key, value, TRUE)` is equivalent to `SET LOCAL`, scoped to the batch transaction
- **Tenant ID validation**: UUID format validation by default, customizable via `validateTenantId`
- **JWT extractor**: Does **not** verify JWT signatures — requires prior authentication middleware (documented in JSDoc)
